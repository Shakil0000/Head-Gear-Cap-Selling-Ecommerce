      <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
      <p>
        We allow our customers to exchange or return a product abiding by
        conditions set for the purpose. You may apply for an Exchange or Return
        for a product or service within 3 days after you’ve received it.
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions for Exchange & Return:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The product must be unused, unworn, unwashed, unaltered, and without
          any flaws. Products can be tried on to see if they fit and will still
          be considered unworn.
        </li>
        <li>The product must be intact with tags.</li>
        <li>
          An exchange or return request must be done within 3 days of the
          purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          All items must be returned in original condition (including all
          receipt/invoice and packaging) with barcode tags attached.
        </li>
        <li>
          The exchanged product must be of equal or higher value than the
          original purchase. If you choose a product with a lower price, no
          refund will be issued for the difference.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What if I lose the money receipt/tags/barcode?</h2>
      <p>
        We will consider it if you lose the money receipt or invoice for
        exchanges. In that case, you will need to provide the purchase contact
        number so we can check your purchase history. The exchange offer will
        no longer be valid anymore for any irreparable damage or bending of the
        tags or barcode.
      </p>

      <h2>Damages and issues:</h2>
      <p>
        Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
        the item is defective, damaged, or if you received the wrong item so we
        can evaluate the issue and make it right.
      </p>

      <h2>Exceptions / non-returnable items:</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.
      </p>
