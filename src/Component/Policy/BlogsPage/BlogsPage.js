      <p className="blogsPage-author">By Imran Hossain, June 26, 2023</p>

      <p className="blogsPage-content">
        Caps have been around for centuries. From the ‘Coif’ of the Middle Ages
        to the “Bucket hat” of today, we have witnessed the versatility and
        evolution of this headwear.
      </p>

      <p className="blogsPage-content">
        In Bangladesh, the “topi” and the conical “Mathal hat” were the first
        headwear worn by people until the British brought caps to the region in
        the 19th century. Since then modern caps have been trendy. Now, there
        are many different cap brands available in Bangladesh, but the first
        cap brand in Bangladesh was <strong>HEADGEAR BD</strong>. In this
        article, we will talk about the birth of the brand and how it targeted
        the Bangladeshi consumer base.

      <h2 className="blogsPage-subtitle">First Cap Brand in Bangladesh: HeadGear BD</h2>

      <p className="blogsPage-content">
        HeadGear BD is the one-stop shop for all your cap and hat needs. It was
        founded in 2017 by two young entrepreneurs Akash and Rony, with the
        dream and vision of bringing contemporary and idiosyncratic designs and
        affordable caps to your doorstep. It has since become one of the most
        popular cap brands in the country.
      </p>

      <p className="blogsPage-content">
        Before HeadGear BD, Bangladesh was awash in low-quality, locally-made
        products. The imported caps were overpriced, which is why the brand
        rose to quench the thirst for good quality caps. They use only the
        finest materials, including cotton, wool, polyester, leather, and
        suede, to create extraordinary caps that will satisfy even the most
        discerning fashionista.
